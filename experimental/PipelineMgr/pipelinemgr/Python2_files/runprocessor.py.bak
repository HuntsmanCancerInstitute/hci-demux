		4/3/2012: now permitting samples without barcodes. These samples will
		have an Null values for the sample.barcode field, and no barcode
		processing will happen for that lane.
		5/16/2012: if only single sample is in a lane, the barcode for
		that sample will be ignored, and it will be treated as if a single
		non-barcoded sample is there. Doing this because sequence quality
		for single barcodes is poor, and many clients just want all the

		11/28/2012: External customer Amplicon Express is submitting libraries
		with 8-base custom barcodes. They submit libraries with any number of
		samples ready for sequencing, but don't want to divulge which samples
		are present. If registered user for Amplicon gets a lane, then the master
		barcode sheet for Amplicon will be subsituted for that lane, so their
		master spreadsheet will get used for every library they submit.
		11/12/2013: Updated to handle paired bar codes.
		03/06/2014: Updated to handle rapid runs. These runs are
		registered in GnomEx as a single lane, but actually have 2
		lanes of data (numbered 1 and 2). GNomEx does not support
		this, so the pipeline is going to fake it by detecting these
		flow cells, and adding a second lane (identical to the first)
